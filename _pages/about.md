Hello! I am Harry Clark, a highly motivated and experienced mechanical engineer with deep experience in Robotics and Mechatronics, as well as the Semiconductor industry. I am currently finishing a Master's of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Santa Clara University, and I have previously received my Bachelor's' of Science in Engineering Physics from the University of California, Berkeley.

My experience spans a wide range of projects, from developing optical metrology systems for semiconductor manufacturing to designing and testing robots for underwater exploration. I am also an accomplished researcher, having published a paper on microrobotics assembly presented at the Transducers conference. My full portfolio can be viewed [here.](https://hclark96.github.io/projects/)

I am a skilled programmer and has experience working in a variety of environments, such as ROS1/2 and MATLAB/Simulink, and regularly work in C, C++, Python, and Ruby. I am also proficient in mechanical design, with deep experience using AutoCAD, SolidWorks, and Fusion360. Furthermore, I have experience with multiple avenues of mechanical analysis, such as FEA (ANSYS) and CFD.

I believe my defining characteristic as an engineer, however, is being a team player with a passion for continuous learning. I bring a creative mindset, always seeking innovative solutions to challenges. More than anything, I am looking to expand my capabilities and hone my skills as a mechatronics engineer.
