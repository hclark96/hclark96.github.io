My first project as a professional engineer, the focus of this project was to replace the aging off-the-shelf spectrometer we used in our tools with a custom in-house design. This required creating a high-level design, identifying parts to use such as reflective diffraction gratings and PDA sensors, simulating the design with Zemax OpticStudio, implementing the design with said parts, and testing/refining the design before creating a final product.
