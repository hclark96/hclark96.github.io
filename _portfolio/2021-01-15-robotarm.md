The focus of this project was to redesign the wafer manipulator arm used in our tools in order to move away from 3rd party vendors and become more independent. I was brought on to help with mechanical design and modelling, and after a great deal of design work and discussion with our partner machine shop, our first prototype was built, and my role shifted to testing designs using dummy wafers, seeking maximum reliability and efficiency. The project was succesfully closed in mid-2022, after almost two years of development.
