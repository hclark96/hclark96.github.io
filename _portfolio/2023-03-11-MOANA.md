For a collaboration with the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), I performed a thermal analysis of one of SCU Robotics Lab/MBARI collaborations, a UAV know as the Modular Oceanic Autonomous Underwater Vehicle for Novel Actuation (MOANA). First, the entire system was modeled in Fusion 360, as prior design files had been lost. This model was then brought into ANSYS, where a full thermal analysis was performed.
