My undergraduate research as a member of the UC Berkeley SWARM Lab was focused on assisting Dr. Hani Gomez in her research of microrobot assembly and design. This included modelling designs in SolidWorks and KLayout (a microchip layout/design software) as well as assembly and testing of designs. The principal project was a Zero-Insertion Force (ZIF) Socket with elctrical throughput for use in microrobot assembly, which was presented at Transducers 2019 in Berlin. The paper, as presented in 2019, can be read [here.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8808253)
